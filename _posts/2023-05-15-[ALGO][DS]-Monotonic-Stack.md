# When to use Monotonic Stack 
Monotonic Stack helps you find the next greater or the next smaller element. It has the following characteristics.
- it is often used to solve "range queries in an array" problem  
- maintain maximum and minimum elements in the range
- keep the order of elements in range 
- element that have been removed never get used again 

# Increasing vs Decreasing 
- Use increasing when you are looking for next smaller element 
- Use decreasing when you are looking for next greater element
